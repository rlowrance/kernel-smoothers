kernel smoothers in lua

This repository will eventually implement in torch 3 kernel smoothers:
* Knn: k nearest neighbors
* Kwavg: kernel-weighted average
* Llr: local linear regression

All the smoothers are described in Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibsharani,
and Jerome Friedman, The Elements of Statistical Learning, Springer,
2001.
